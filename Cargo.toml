# Wait, but why did you vendor libmem-rs with a patch?
# that is because the build.rs file needs to be patched to build the project and link it
# this is not possible to fix without patching
#
# Please see the build.rs file in vendor/libmem-rs !
# you may want to customize it, e.g. cache the built lib, since it takes awhile to build it
#
# We also added an edit to the Cargo.toml for build-dependencies since we used them in build.rs
# that's it! Those are the only edits!
#
# Let's hope it gets fixed soon!
